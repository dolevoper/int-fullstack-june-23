Implement a deconstrcuted pancake layout!
(if you are really stuck, you can search for deconstructed pancakes for solutions)

It's a card "gallery" view
* the gallery takes all of the available width in the window
* when the window gets smaller, cards get smaller
* when the cards are smaller than a certain point, the amount of items per row decreases (and cards get bigger again)
* items get smaller and row length is cut as the screen gets smaller until there is only 1 item per row

first do it without images, only text. try to add images and see what breaks (specifically with large images)
