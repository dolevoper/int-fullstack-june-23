1. Implement "divide" button - just like the double button, divide the value by 2
2. Finish multi counter implementation
3. Allow to create new counters and delete existing counter in the UI
4. Persist all counter states to storage and load on refresh
5. Build a to-do app OO style (or any other app you'd like)
