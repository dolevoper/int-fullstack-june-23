Build a simple data management system.  
The system should have an array of object and allowed operations the user can execute from a main menu.  
You choose the theme (what the objects represent) and the allowed operatios.

Try to have more "interesting" entity - try to have fields that are arrays or objects and not only numbers and strings.

Extra level of difficulty:  
Add another entity to your system and model the relation between the entities and add operations on the relation.  
Example: students and teachers - you can manage the students separately (add student, modify his details, remove student, etc.), you can manage the teachers separately (add, modify, remove, etc.) and there is also a relation between students and teachers (a student can take a class with a teacher). So there are also operations on the **relation** (enroll a student into a class, student quits a class, etc.)
