Create an app on a subject you like.

## Level 1
1. The app should have a form for adding new stuff.
2. Once added a list of all the stuff should be updated bellow the form.
3. The form should have some validation logic, use Errors and try/catch to validate the form and display the errors to the user on the page.
4. The list should be persisted to local storage and loaded from there on page load.

## Level 2
1. Add a button to each item in the list that will delete the item from the list.
2. Add a button to each item in the list that will edit the item.
3. Add buttons to each item in the list to move the item up and down the list.

## Level 3
1. Add login and registration pages to the app.
2. The login/register forms should have validation logic, similar to the form in level 1.
3. Add a logout button to the app.
4. Items in the list should be associated with the user that created them.

## Level 4
1. Add a list of users to the app.
2. Add another entity to the app that is associated with users - for example likes, comments, etc.
3. Make some functionality of the app available only to logged in users.
