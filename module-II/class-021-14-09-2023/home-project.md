Choose between:

1. Complete the class project (do both 2 and 3). You can add additional functionality, like editting more car details, deleting a car, keeping driver's details etc.
2. Create your own complete app with a form and manage a list of entities of your choice.
3. Extra challenge - implement custom validation (instead of the builtin popup messages when trying to submit the form)
