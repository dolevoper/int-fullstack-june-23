## Nim

Nim is a 2 player game.  
There are 13 matches on the table at the beginning of the game.  
Each player in his turn **must** take 1, 2 or 3 matches from the pile.  
The player to take the last match, loses.

2. Implement a single player version, with 3 levels of difficulty:
   - Easy - the computer goes first and just takes a random number of matches on each turn
   - Medium - the computer goes first, on the first turn it will take a random number of matches. Starting from his next turn, the computer will try to win if giver the chance.
   - Impossible - the computer goes second and wins every time.
3. Build a main menu
