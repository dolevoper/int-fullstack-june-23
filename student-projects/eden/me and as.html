    <h1>my journey</h1>
    <br>
    <article> It all starts when i was 21
        <br>

        It was a normal day, I went to work and when I returned home I started having severe pain, 
        <br>
      </h6>when I went to the doctor he repeatedly said it was a pelvic infection 
       <a class="reference" id="refrence-top" href="#reference-content"></a> 
        <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352594">[more information]</a></h6>
        <br>
        <div class="tooltip">click
            <span class="tooltiptext">hello</span> 
        </div>
        and not something serious but I knew something was wrong in my body.
        I insisted and so they sent me for tests to find out what the problem was.
        <br>
        After a few days of receiving the answers, the doctor told me that I have a disease called AS or in Hebrew stiffening vertebrae.
        <br>
        I didn't know what awaited me and what I was facing, 
        <br>
        but the doctor reassured me that there was treatment and that it was possible to live a completely normal life alongside the disease.
        <br>
        and so it was.
        The first days in dealing with the disease were difficult not only physically but mentally.
            <br>
Digesting the situation was strange and difficult at the same time.
<br>
At first I didn't understand what I was supposed to do
<br>
if I was supposed to change my behavior I was supposed to sit at home and suffer whether I could go out and behave like a normal person before the pain.
<br>
The months passed and that's how I researched the disease,
<br>
 what could be done in addition to medication.
<br>
I entered every possible forum, every group on Facebook and thus I discovered a whole world of people who suffer from similar diseases,
<br>
 each of whom is a whole world that helps and supports the "newcomers".
 <br>
After a lot of questions, searches, doubts and pain, 
<br>
I discovered that along with the medication, I would also have to start exercising regularly in order to reduce the pain, and that's how it really was.</p>
The first trainings were difficult, the pains were unbearable 
    <br>
    but little by little the pains subsided and I started to return to the life before 
    <br>
    but along with the medicines and the trainings.
    <br>
    I had to accept the fact that I live alongside a chronic illness, medication and non-stop training in order to live a "normal life".
