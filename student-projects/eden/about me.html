    <h1>About my disease</h1>
    <P>As ankylosing spondylitis worsens, new bone forms as part of the body's attempt to heal. 
        <br>
        The new bone gradually bridges the gaps between vertebrae and eventually fuses sections of vertebrae together. 
        <br>
        Fused vertebrae can flatten the natural curves of the spine, which causes an inflexible, hunched posture.</P>
