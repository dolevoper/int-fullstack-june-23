/*
Option I
Write the following function:

printTo
Input - a number
Output - print all the whole numbers from 1 to the input number
isOdd
Input - a number
Output - return true if the number is odd, false otherwise
isEven
Input - a number
Output - return true if the number is even, false otherwise
isPalindrome
Input - a string
Output - return true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise
improved isPalindrome
Input - a string or a number
Output - return true if the input is a palindrome, false otherwise
safeDiv
Input - 2 numbers
Output - return null if the second number is 0, the ratio between the numbers otherwise
improved safeDiv
Input - 2 numbers
Output - the ratio between the numbers
If the second number is 0, the program should not compile
fizzBuzz
Input - a number
Output - print all the whole numbers from 1 to the input.
If the number has a 5 or is divisible by 5, print "fizz" instead.
If the number has a 7 or is divisible by 7, print "buzz" instead.
If it's both, print "fizzbuzz"

Option II
Improved pythagoras.

Ask the user if he wants to calculate the hypotenuse of know if 3 values are a valid right triangle edges.
Run the correct program - divide to functions, validate inputs etc...

Option III
Improved guess my number

Make sure you have all the required input validations
User should have infinite guesses
Separate to functions - some functions are used to avoid repeating code (like validation), and some are used for organization.
Add a main menu
Options: Play, Choose difficulty, Quit
When player looses/wins/quits - go back to main menu
Don't ask for the difficulty in the beginning. Default is normal, player can change the difficulty from the main menu
