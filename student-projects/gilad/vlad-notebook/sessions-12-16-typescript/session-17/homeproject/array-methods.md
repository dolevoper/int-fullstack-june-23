# Array Methods Implementation

## Target

Choose any array method (use MDN to find) that we did not cover during class. Implement it on your own using for/while loops. This must be submitted as a function, not as free code.

# Implemented Array Methods

## `at()`

the `at()` method returns an element from the array at a specified index, which can be positive or negative.

### Arguments

- **array** - The target array from which we want to recieve the element.
- **index** - An index specifies the location of the item we want to recieve from the target array. Positive index starts from 0, negative index starts from `array.length` and counts backwards.

### Return Values

- **array element** - The element of the target array at the specified index.
- **undefined** - If the array element at the specified index does not exist.
