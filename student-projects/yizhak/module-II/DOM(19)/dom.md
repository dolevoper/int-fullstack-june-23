Document Object:

The top-level object in the DOM hierarchy.
Represents the entire HTML or XML document.
Accessed using document in JavaScript.
Nodes:

In the DOM, everything is a node.
Nodes are elements, attributes, text within elements, and more.
Nodes are organized in a hierarchical tree structure with the document node at the root.
Elements:

HTML elements are represented as element nodes in the DOM.
You can access elements by their tag names, IDs, classes, or other attributes.
Common methods include getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and getElementsByTagName().
Attributes:

Elements can have attributes, such as src, href, class, etc.
You can access and manipulate attributes using JavaScript.
Traversal:

You can navigate the DOM tree using methods like parentNode, childNodes, nextSibling, and previousSibling.
Manipulation:

JavaScript allows you to add, modify, or remove elements and their attributes.
Common methods include createElement(), appendChild(), removeChild(), and setAttribute().
Events:

You can attach event listeners to DOM elements to respond to user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.
Common event handling methods include addEventListener() and removeEventListener().
Style Manipulation:

You can change the CSS properties of elements using JavaScript.
Common properties include style.backgroundColor, style.fontSize, etc.
Forms:

You can access and manipulate form elements and their values.
Common form-related methods include getElementById(), submit(), and reset().
Document Loading and Manipulation:

You can manipulate the DOM as the document is loading (e.g., using DOMContentLoaded event) or after it has loaded (e.g., using window.onload event).
XML and DOM:

The DOM can be used with XML documents in addition to HTML.
This allows for the manipulation of structured data.
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Different browsers may have slight variations in how they implement the DOM.
Libraries like jQuery and modern JavaScript frameworks often abstract these differences for cross-browser compatibility.
