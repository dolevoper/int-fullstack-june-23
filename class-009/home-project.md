Choose one of:
* Accordion - modify it so only one could be opened at a time
* Button - change the hover to a "shake" or "spring" animation
* Image carousel
* Recreate one of the animations here: https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-examples - don't look at the solutions, choose a fitting challange and try to recreate only from looking at the end result.
